👋, I'm Jan!

I'm a product manager living in Berlin, who enjoys building new products and drinking old scotch.

I currently lead product in [Back](https://backhq.com) 🚀, building products for the workplace 👩‍💻. Before that I was leading the product teams in Marley Spoon 🍱 and Fyber 📱.

In my free time I'm on a quest to make the best gin basil smash 🍸. I also ride my bike 🚴 around Berlin and obsess about coffee ☕️.

## My Projects

### [365 days with my Apple Watch](https://aw.honza.xyz/)
After I got my Apple Watch a year ago I dug deep into my activity data to see what patterns I can discover and visualize with pretty charts.

The best places to eat, drink, and see in Berlin and Prague, as curated by my girlfriend and me.
